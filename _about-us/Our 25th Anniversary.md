<p>In celebration of Canberra Primary School’s 25th Anniversary, we have
launched a commemorative logo to celebrate this important milestone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bold "25" symbolizes the strong legacy Canberra Primary School has
built over time, while the interlocking design highlights teamwork and
collaboration among our students, staff, and community. It also reflects
the celebration of diversity within our school, where individuals from
different backgrounds come together as one. The theme ‘Celebrating Our
Legacy, Shaping New Horizons’ and our motto ‘In Pursuit of Excellence’
reflect the school’s commitment to continuous growth, innovation, and inspiration.</p>
<p>The flowing lines suggest energy and progress, representing our school’s
forward-thinking approach to education. Aligned with the nation’s call
for globalization, Canberra Primary School sets exemplary standards by
fostering a culture that goes beyond academic achievement, emphasizing
the importance of instilling strong moral values in our students.</p>
<p>The school ensures that our students have access to holistic education
and the right values from a tender age, providing a strong foundation that
enables every individual to contribute meaningfully to society and the
nation. This logo celebrates Canberra Primary School’s legacy of excellence
and its dedication to shaping future-ready, responsible citizens.</p>
