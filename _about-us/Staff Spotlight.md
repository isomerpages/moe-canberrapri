<p><strong>Staff Achievements</strong>
<br>In Canberra Primary, our dedicated and caring staff are committed to work
collaboratively in ongoing processes of co-designing and refining lesson
packages to ignite the Joy of Learning in students. Through the subject-based
and Level-based Professional Learning Teams (PLTs), teachers meet to clarify
essential student learning, develop holistic assessments for learning,
analyze studentsâ€™ artefacts to close learning gaps and design innovative
student-centric lesson packages to develop pupils to be Discoverers, Attuned
and Global learners. Canberra Primary staff take ownership and leadership
in sharing the PLT and department lesson packages with the fraternity at
various platforms. As a Canberra family, we would like to acknowledge and
celebrate the achievements of our staff.</p>
