**Staff Achievements**<br>
In Canberra Primary, our dedicated and caring staff are committed to work collaboratively in ongoing processes of co-designing and refining lesson packages to ignite the Joy of Learning in students. Through the subject-based and Level-based Professional Learning Teams (PLTs), teachers meet to clarify essential student learning, develop holistic assessments for learning, analyze students’ artefacts to close learning gaps and design innovative student-centric lesson packages to develop pupils to be Discoverers, Attuned and Global learners. 
Canberra Primary staff take ownership and leadership in sharing the PLT and department lesson packages with the fraternity at various platforms. As a Canberra family, we would like to acknowledge and celebrate the achievements of our staff. <br>
