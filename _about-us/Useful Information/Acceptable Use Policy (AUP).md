<p><strong><u>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for use of EdTech Resources</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. Canberra
Primary School</p>
<p>has established AUP guidelines on the appropriate use of EdTech resources
to help</p>
<p>students understand how to use these resources safely and responsibly,
in line with</p>
<p>efforts to develop their digital literacies and growth as digitally responsible
citizens.</p>
<p>EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>• Learning devices (e.g. Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), school devices)</p>
<p>• ICT system accounts (e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), iCON);</p>
<p>and school internet networks.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>1. Students should not attempt to access data, system and information
that they</p>
<p>are not authorised to.</p>
<p>2. Students are reminded that the use of learning devices and school’s
EdTech</p>
<p>resources should solely be for the purpose of learning.</p>
<p>Using Personal Learning Devices (PLD) for Primary 4 to 6 Students</p>
<p>3. Students are responsible in caring for their PLD.</p>
<p>4. In order to have a positive learning experience, students should ensure
that their</p>
<p>PLD are fully charged before bringing them to school.</p>
<p>5. Students are reminded to keep their PLD updated by installing the relevant</p>
<p>patches and updates when being prompted by the system.</p>
<p>6. Students are responsible for regularly backing up their learning materials
in their</p>
<p>PLD to prevent data loss.</p>
<p>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</p>
<p>7. Students should interact with others in a respectful and responsible
way. They</p>
<p>should not post online remarks that are</p>
<p>• racially and/or religiously insensitive,</p>
<p>• vulgar and/or offensive, or</p>
<p>• hurtful to others.</p>
<p>8. Students should not use any devices to</p>
<p>• store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations,</p>
<p>pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic,</p>
<p>defamatory, hurtful to self or others).</p>
<p>• make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or</p>
<p>intimidate others.</p>
<p>9. Students should not use MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts for
any</p>
<p>commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p>Non-compliance with the above will lead to disciplinary action in accordance
with the</p>
<p>school’s discipline policy.</p>
<p>Respecting Copyright</p>
<p>10. Students are reminded to obtain explicit permission from the content
owner(s)</p>
<p>before downloading, copying or sharing any copyrighted materials (e.g.
pictures,</p>
<p>videos, music).</p>
<p>11. Students should not use, copy, edit or share digital files in an unauthorised</p>
<p>illegal manner.</p>
<p>Staying Safe and Secure online</p>
<p>12. Students should report any incidents (e.g. unusual device behaviour
or</p>
<p>inappropriate use of devices), to the school.</p>
<p>13. Students are reminded to develop online safety habits. This includes
not</p>
<p>disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS password, PLD passcode,</p>
<p>etc.), sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, passwords) online or
on AI</p>
<p>platforms, verifying credibility of online content before sharing, avoiding
clicking</p>
<p>on suspicious links or downloading unknown files, and being cautious when</p>
<p>interacting with others online(e.g. on social media) by not engaging with</p>
<p>strangers.</p>
<p>14. Students should exercise caution regarding the limitations of AI tools,
including</p>
<p>potential inaccuracies/fabricated responses, inherent biases and outdated</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p>15. Students must meet the minimum age requirement specified in each AI
tool's</p>
<p>age restrictions before using it.</p>
<p>16. Students’ use of AI if permitted must be with adult supervision. They
must</p>
<p>acknowledge any AI use in weighted assessments and homework as required.</p>
<p>17. Students are to practice academic integrity and be responsible for
their own</p>
<p>learning when using AI. They must understand that they are short-changing</p>
<p>themselves if they pass off other’s work as their own.</p>
<p>Digital Wellbeing and Balance</p>
<p>18. Students are reminded to balance screen time with other activities</p>
<p>including physical exercise and face-to-face social interactions.</p>
<p>19. Students should avoid excessive use of their devices outside learning
hours.</p>
<p>20. Students should take regular breaks to rest their eyes and mind.</p>
<p>21. Students are reminded to practice good sleep hygiene by not using
their</p>
<p>devices one hour before bedtime.</p>
