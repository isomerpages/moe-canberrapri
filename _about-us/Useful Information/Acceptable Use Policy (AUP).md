<p><strong><u>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for use of EdTech Resources</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. Canberra
Primary School has established AUP guidelines on the appropriate use of EdTech resources to help students understand how to use these resources safely and responsibly, in line with efforts to develop their digital literacies and growth as digitally responsible
citizens.</p>
<p>EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>• Learning devices (e.g. Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), school devices)</p>
<p>• ICT system accounts (e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), iCON); and school internet networks.</p>
<p><b>General</b></p>
<p>1. Students should not attempt to access data, system and information that they are not authorised to.</p>
<p>2. Students are reminded that the use of learning devices and school’s EdTech resources should solely be for the purpose of learning.</p>
<p><b>Using Personal Learning Devices (PLD) for Primary 4 to 6 Students</b></p>
<p>3. Students are responsible in caring for their PLD.</p>
<p>4. In order to have a positive learning experience, students should ensure that their PLD are fully charged before bringing them to school.</p>
<p>5. Students are reminded to keep their PLD updated by installing the relevant patches and updates when being prompted by the system.</p>
<p>6. Students are responsible for regularly backing up their learning materials in their PLD to prevent data loss.</p>
<p><b>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</b></p>
<p>7. Students should interact with others in a respectful and responsible way. They should not post online remarks that are</p>
<p>• racially and/or religiously insensitive,</p>
<p>• vulgar and/or offensive, or</p>
<p>• hurtful to others.</p>
<p>8. Students should not use any devices to</p>
<p>• store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations, pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic, defamatory, hurtful to self or others).</p>
<p>• make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or intimidate others.</p>
<p>9. Students should not use MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts for any commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p>Non-compliance with the above will lead to disciplinary action in accordance with the school’s discipline policy.</p>
<p><b>Respecting Copyright</b></p>
<p>10. Students are reminded to obtain explicit permission from the content owner(s) before downloading, copying or sharing any copyrighted materials (e.g. pictures, videos, music).</p>
<p>11. Students should not use, copy, edit or share digital files in an unauthorised illegal manner.</p>
<p><b>Staying Safe and Secure online</b></p>
<p>12. Students should report any incidents (e.g. unusual device behaviour or inappropriate use of devices), to the school.</p>
<p>13. Students are reminded to develop online safety habits. This includes not disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS password, PLD passcode, etc.), sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, passwords) online or on AI platforms, verifying credibility of online content before sharing, avoiding
clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files, and being cautious when interacting with others online(e.g. on social media) by not engaging with strangers.</p>
<p>14. Students should exercise caution regarding the limitations of AI tools, including potential inaccuracies/fabricated responses, inherent biases and outdated information.</p>
<p><b>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b></p>
<p>15. Students must meet the minimum age requirement specified in each AI tool's age restrictions before using it.</p>
<p>16. Students’ use of AI if permitted must be with adult supervision. They must acknowledge any AI use in weighted assessments and homework as required.</p>
<p>17. Students are to practice academic integrity and be responsible for their own learning when using AI. They must understand that they are short-changing themselves if they pass off other’s work as their own.</p>
<p><b>Digital Wellbeing and Balance</b></p>
<p>18. Students are reminded to balance screen time with other activities including physical exercise and face-to-face social interactions.</p>
<p>19. Students should avoid excessive use of their devices outside learning hours.</p>
