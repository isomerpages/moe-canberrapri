This logo depicts the school as a modern outfit, forward looking in nature and bold in outlook. The 3 stylised calligraphic strokes depict the letter "C", "P" and "S", which are also the initials of the school. The blue background denotes the sea of diversity.

Facing the letter S is a sphere representing a globe. The globe represents the long-term goal of the school. To support the nation's call for globalisation by setting the right standards and a culture which goes beyond the mere pursuit of academic excellence, one that also places emphasis on building the right set of moral values in its students.

The school ensures that young children placed in its care have the opportunity to receive total education, and the right principles from a very tender age to enable them to contribute to society and nation. This is Canberra Primary School's goal and contribution to the nation.
