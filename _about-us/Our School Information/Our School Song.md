# School Song
**Verse**

We all love to be in Canberra Primary<br>
Where there's love and care for everyone<br>
On our part we'll be the best we can<br>
And bring honour to our dear school<br>
We will be creative in our thinking<br>
In pursuit of excellence<br>
Prepare ourselves to meet all challenges<br>
And be the pride of our school<br>


We are proud to be in Canberra Primary<br>
Let us pledge our love and loyalty<br>
Bringing fame and glory to our dear school<br>
As we grow to be good citizens<br>
Let's be creative in our thinking<br>
In pursuit of excellence<br>
Prepare ourselves to meet all challenges<br>
And be the pride of our school<br>

**Coda**<br>

Canberra we love you dearly<br>
Canberra show us the way<br>
To success, glory and pride<br>
