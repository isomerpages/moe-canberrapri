Canberra Primary School was established in January 2000.

The school initially functioned at Wellington Primary School, and moved into its new premises at 21 Admiralty Drive in November 2000. It caters to the educational needs of pupil population in the new Sembawang Estate. Currently, the school has an Enrollment of 1380 pupils and functions as a single session.

Canberra Primary was part of the FutureSchools@Singapore (FS@SG) programme. This programme was a collaboration between the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) to effectively harness the benefits of technology for engaged learning. Although MOE has officially concluded the FutureSchools@Singapore Programme in 2014, Canberra Primary continues to integrate FS technologies and development into our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) to create an engaging Canberra Experience for all pupils.

Both the school leadership and the staff aspire to develop the strength of character and build the capacity and potential of every pupil in the school. The school also strives to inspire a passion in teaching and commitment to excellence in each of its teachers. Through its mission, vision, and core values as well as its strategic thrusts, the school aims for high achievements and the creation of a holistic learning and nurturing environment.
