**Nurturing Hearts, Growing Beyond**

 
Warmest greetings from all of us at Canberra Primary School!

As we reflect on 2025 and look forward to an exciting year ahead, we are extremely thankful for our team of dedicated staff, supportive parents, as well as students whom we have the privilege of educating. As a school community, we celebrate the strong performance of our 2025 Primary Six graduands, who have done us proud by performing well at the Primary School Leaving Examination. We wish them all the very best in their endeavours as they embark on an exciting new phase of learning in their secondary schools. 

As we move into 2026, we welcome Mr Tay Yu Zhe, who has joined the Canberra Primary family as Vice Principal. 

The theme for 2026 ‘Nurturing Hearts, Growing Beyond’ celebrates both the emotional and intellectual development of each of our students, while embracing growth that transcends the classroom. It provides staff, students and various stakeholders such as our Parent Support Group and School Advisory Committee a focus on developing our students to find personal success in discovering and pursuing their strengths and passions, as well as to help them discover, develop and draw out the talents inside each one of them.

For our Applied Learning Programme ‘Start Young, Start It Right – Curating My Learning’, students  can continue to look forward to a more connected learning experience, enhanced by the use of  Personal Learning Devices in authentic settings. Varied learning experiences, such as coding, are also designed to help pupils acquire critical thinking skills. Likewise, our Learn for Life Programme ‘Immersing in Canberra Experience through Musical Theatre Education’ allows students to explore issues and emotions,  develop empathy for the experiences of others and explore diverse perspectives as we prepare them to become more confident, creative and collaborative individuals.

To our parents, thank you for your unwavering trust and partnership. Your involvement and encouragement are vital to your child’s success. We look forward to working closely with you to create a nurturing and stimulating learning environment for our students.

To our staff, we are deeply grateful for your passion, dedication, and commitment. You are the heart of our school, and your efforts make a lasting difference in the lives of our students every day. May this year bring you continued inspiration and professional fulfilment.

And to our students, we wish you a year filled with opportunities to grow as Discoverers, Learners and Leaders. Be kind, curious, and never afraid to try something new. You can show kindness by helping a new classmate feel welcome, or by offering encouragement to a friend who is facing a challenge. Be curious by asking questions in class or exploring new books in the library. Do not be afraid to step outside your comfort zone, whether it’s participating in a class performance or tackling a difficult project as every new experience helps you grow. 

Together, let us nurture our hearts, grow beyond our limits, and make this year our best one yet.

We wish everyone a blessed, healthy, and fruitful 2026 ahead.

Varied learning experiences, such as coding, are also curated to help them acquire critical thinking skills. In Primary 5 and 6, ‘Ready for Tomorrow – Orientation to My Future Learning’ continues their technology-enabled applied learning with a focus on production and leveraging digital media and communication elements to engage and influence, allowing them to discover their interests and talents, develop life skills, a sense of curiosity and a love for learning.

Some recent improvements made include refreshing outdoor learning areas such as the Green Wonderland and Mushroom Loft. Moving ahead, we will look into enhancing the school environment to optimise learning and provide opportunities for students to explore their creative talents, and to build their social and emotional competencies.
