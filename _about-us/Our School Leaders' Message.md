### Our Hopes, Our Dreams

Warmest greetings from all of us at Canberra Primary School!

As we reflect on 2023 and look forward to an exciting year ahead, we are extremely thankful for our team of dedicated staff, supportive parents, as well as students whom we have the privilege of educating. As a school community, we celebrate the strong performance of our 2023 Primary Six graduands, who have done us proud by performing well at the Primary School Leaving Examination. We wish them all the very best in their endeavours as they embark on an exciting new phase of learning in their secondary schools. 

Our theme for 2024 is a continuation of the theme for 2023.  ‘Our Hopes, Our Dreams’ provides staff, students and various stakeholders such as our Parent Support Group and School Advisory Committee a focus on developing our students to find personal success in discovering and pursuing their strengths and passions, as well as to help them discover, develop and draw out the talents inside each one of them.

Our school’s programmes are geared towards ensuring Canberrians are developed holistically and equipped with the knowledge, skills, values and dispositions that are essential in the 21st Century.  For our Applied Learning Programme ‘Start Young, Start It Right – Curating My Learning’, students can continue to look forward to a more connected learning experience, enhanced by the use of learning devices in authentic settings. Varied learning experiences, such as coding, are also designed to help them acquire critical thinking skills. Likewise, our Learn for Life Programme ‘Immersing in Canberra Experience through Musical Theatre Education’ allows students to explore issues and emotions, develop empathy for the experiences of others and explore diverse perspectives as we prepare them to become more confident, creative and collaborative individuals.

To better support our students in learning, we have been upgrading our facilities to create a more conducive and vibrant learning environment. Some improvements made include renovating our school library, affectionately known as Canberra Cove, outdoor learning areas such as the Learning Oasis as well as collaborative learning hubs. To facilitate our students exploring, creating and discovering, the ‘Just Play’ initiative was started, providing them with play areas to boost their physical, social and emotional development. Moving ahead, we will look into enhancing the school environment to optimise learning and provide opportunities for students to explore their creative talents, and to build their social and emotional competencies.

We look forward to working with all our stakeholders, especially parents, to support the growth and development of our students in their pursuit of excellence.
