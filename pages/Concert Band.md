**Recollections of 2018 - 2019**

The band regularly performs at school celebrations and events. The performed music pieces and titles are carefully selected by the teachers and instructors for every event.

One memorable event was the 2018 and 2019 Mid-Autumn Festival where the band played under the dim moonlight. Our first piece was an evergreen classic sung by Theresa Deng, 月亮代表我的心. It was followed by 城里的月光, sung by local artist 许美静, Mavis Hee, a theme song from a drama in the mid-90s. The music evoked memories and touched the hearts of the audience, with the band receiving a standing ovation at the end of the performance. We would also like to express our thanks to Mr Pisit, our Assistant Band instructor for arranging the composition at our musicianship level.

This year 2019, the band played for Chinese New Year Celebrations for the first time. In a short span of time with only 3 practice sessions, the band learnt and performed two songs, 恭喜恭喜 (Translated Gong Xi Gong Xi) and 大地回春 (Translated Spring returns to earth).
