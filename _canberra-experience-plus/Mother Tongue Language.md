**Vision:** Our pupils will be passionate and lifelong learners of the Mother Tongue Language

**Mission:** To create an environment where pupils will learn and apply the Mother Tongue Language effectively and confidently

Bingualism being the cornerstone of our education system, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department aligns our curricular goals with the national curriculum and strives to engage our pupils in joyful learning and enable them to communicate effectively and confidently in MTL and have a deeper appreciation of their cultural heritage. 

To better engage our pupils, we create opportunities for them to learn and apply the various language skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing, as well as spoken and written interaction) in authentic situations within and beyond the classroom. MTL lessons are also infused with Curriculum Integration (CI) and e-Pedagogy to make the learning of MTL more interesting.
