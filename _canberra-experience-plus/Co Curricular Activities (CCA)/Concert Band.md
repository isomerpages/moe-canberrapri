<p>Since its inception in 2010, the CPS Concert Band has been involved in
Biannual Singapore Youth Festival and various school performances such
as Musicals, National Day Observance Ceremony and Annual Awards Day. The
Band Studio, which was officially opened on 22 May 2015, provides a conducive
environment for our young musicians to develop their love for music and
discover their talents within.</p>
<p>Together with our nurturing teachers and instructors, we welcome all students
to join us. No prior music background is required, just the love for music
and the perseverance to learn a new instrument. Come and join us, and discover
your passion for making music!</p>
