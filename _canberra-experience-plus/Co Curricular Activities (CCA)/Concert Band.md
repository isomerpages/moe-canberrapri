<p>Since its inception in 2010, the CPS Concert Band has been involved in
various school performances such as our School Musicals, Open House, National
Day Observance Ceremony and Annual Awards Day. The Band Studio, which was
officially opened on 22 May 2015, provides a conducive environment for
our young musicians to develop their love for music and discover their
talents within.</p>
<p>Together with our nurturing teachers and instructors, we welcome all students
to join us. No prior music background is required, just the love for music
and the perseverance to learn a new instrument. Come and join us, and discover
your passion for making music!</p>
