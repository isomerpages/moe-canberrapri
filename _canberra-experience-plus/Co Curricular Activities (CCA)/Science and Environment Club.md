<p>The Science and Environment Club aims to create awareness among students
about environmental issues and the scientific basis behind them. Our aim
is also to make students to be green ambassadors to voice out concerns
and ideas to solve any environmental issues in the school context.</p>
<p>In Semester 1, students will be learning how to take care of community
plants from NParks, growing our own vegetables using aeroponics and learning
the use of an eco digester and be ambassadors of the environment. They
will carry out upcycling activities and learn how they can do their part
to reduce waste in the environment.</p>
<p>In Semester 2, the students will be continuing the aeroponics and growing
their own mushrooms to experience growing and eating their own food. They
will continue to monitor the school biodiversity and create the Canberra
Nature Bulletin.</p>
