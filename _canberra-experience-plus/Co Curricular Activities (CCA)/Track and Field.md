<p>Canberra Primary School’s Track &amp; Field CCA aspires to be a platform
for our pupils to develop perseverance and exhibit commitment in developing
their techniques and talents in various track and field events.</p>
<p>Pupils develop athletic prowess and values such as teamwork, responsibility
and leadership through intensive training sessions and sports events. With
that, we hope that all members of the CCA, affectionately called the Thunderbirds,
will continue applying relevant skills that they have learnt in pursuit
of excellence.</p>
<p>Our pupils take part in the yearly NSG Competitions.</p>
