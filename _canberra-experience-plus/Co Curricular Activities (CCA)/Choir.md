The school's Choir was set up in 2000. Under the care of our teachers-in-charge and instructors, the present CPS Choir has learnt not only to sing harmoniously, but also demonstrated the School Values (iCREST). These have helped to develop our Choir members’ self-confidence and leadership skills. To date, the choir has participated in eight Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentations, including the most recent one in 2022.

During practice sessions throughout the year, our members go through specialised vocal training conducted by qualified instructors using a wide range of song repertoire including both local and global works. Music concepts such as pitch, harmony, expression and rhythm are taught through choral singing and accompanying fun activities.
