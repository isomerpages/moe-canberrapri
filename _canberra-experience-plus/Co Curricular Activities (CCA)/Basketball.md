<p>Basketball is a popular co-curricular activity offered at Canberra Primary
School. It provides students with the opportunity to develop important
values such as resilience, teamwork, determination, and excellence. Through
regular practice and participation in trainings, matches and tournaments,
students can improve their physical fitness, coordination, and strategic
thinking abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the hard work and guidance from our nurturing basketball teachers
and coaches, the junior girls' basketball team has shown remarkable success,
achieving 1<sup>st</sup> Award in the 2024 SPSSC NSG Basketball Championship
(Tiered Round). This accomplishment is a testament to the dedication and
hard work of the players, as well as the support of their coaches and teammates.
By participating in basketball, these students not only develop their athletic
abilities but also learn important life skills that will serve them well
in the future.</p>
