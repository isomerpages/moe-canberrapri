<p>Basketball is a popular co-curricular activity offered at Canberra Primary
School, and it provides students with an opportunity to develop important
values such as resilience, teamwork, determination, and excellence. Through
regular practice and participation in trainings, matches and tournaments,
students improve their physical fitness, coordination, and strategic thinking
abilities.</p>
<p>With the hard work and guidance from our nurturing basketball teachers
and coaches, the senior girls' basketball team has shown remarkable success,
achieving top 4 finishes in the 2023 North Zone Basketball Championship.
This accomplishment is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the
players, as well as the support of their coaches and teammates. By participating
in basketball, these students not only develop their athletic abilities
but also learn important life skills that will serve them well in the future.</p>
