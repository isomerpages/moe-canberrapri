<p>CPS Football CCA aims to build the resilience, confidence and teamwork
of our students using football as a platform to achieve these values. Students
learn the basics of football such as passing the ball, receiving the ball,
finding positions before progressing towards higher order skills such as
shooting, making correct runs, and tactical gameplay.</p>
<p>Selected students have the opportunity to participate and represent our
school in the National School Games for an invaluable sporting experience
playing with other schools. Along the way, students are also expected to
learn the values of sportsmanship and striving to be their best.</p>
