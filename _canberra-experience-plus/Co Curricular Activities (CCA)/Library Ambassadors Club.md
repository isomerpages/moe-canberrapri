<p>Step into the literary world with the Library Ambassadors Club as our
CCA members spark and ignite the love and joy in reading amongst their
peers through book reviews, sharings and recommendations during the morning
pre-assembly. They also leverage on technology-enabled applied learning
experience by using their 1:1 Personal Learning Device (iPads) to create
digital flipbooks to engage their readers.</p>
<p>The CCA members also help in the daily operations and maintenance of the
library and also serve as student Library Ambassadors during school events.</p>
<p>Library Ambassadors Club aims:
