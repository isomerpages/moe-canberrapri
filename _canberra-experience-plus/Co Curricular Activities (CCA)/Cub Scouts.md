<p>CPS Cub Scouts aims to provide a group environment which is intellectually
stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the basic
need to face and overcome challenges. Our Cub Scouts participate in activities
covering a wide range of subjects and interests and are guided to exemplify
the Scout Promise, Law and Motto (Do Our Best!).</p>
<p>Students celebrate Founders’ Day in February and complete activities to
attain their Silver Progress Badges. Cubs will also reflect on the environmental
challenges they had completed as part of the 2023 Diamond Jubilee Challenge
(DJC). This year’s theme of Skills for Life enables Cubs to develop universal
skills that would serve them well as they navigate an increasingly dynamic
and fast-paced world. We also take part in our school parade for our National
Day Celebrations and have our highly anticipated year-end camp with the
Brownies!</p>
