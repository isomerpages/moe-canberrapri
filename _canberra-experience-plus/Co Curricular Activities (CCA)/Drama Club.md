<p>In Canberra Primary School, the Drama Club members are taught the core
basics of dramatic technique. They get the opportunity to exhibit what
they have mastered through various school-based performances and competitions,
like our own production entitled ‘Say It Right’ that is written and directed
by own our pupils. Our artists are also exposed to a myriad of experiences
such as script-writing and stage craft which includes making props or designing
costumes. Each year, the Drama Club will showcase their performance in
a school assembly programme.</p>
<p>This year, Drama Club had the opportunity to perform a skit entitled,
The Legend of Nian’ at Canberra Park as part of Chinese New Year Celebration.
It was indeed a crowning achievement for our budding actors and actresses
as it was the first public stint by our Drama Club for the year.</p>
