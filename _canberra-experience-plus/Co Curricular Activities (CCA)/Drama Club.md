In Canberra Primary School, the Drama Club members are taught the core basics of dramatic technique. They get the opportunity to exhibit what they have mastered through various school-based performances and competitions, like our own production entitled ‘Say It Right’ that is written and directed by own our pupils. Our artists are also exposed to a myriad of experiences such as script-writing and stage craft which includes making props or designing costumes. Each year, the Drama Club will showcase their performance in a school assembly programme. 

This year, Drama Club had the opportunity to perform a skit entitled, The Legend of Nian’ at Canberra Park as part of Chinese New Year Celebration. It was indeed a crowning achievement for our budding actors and actresses as it was the first public stint by our Drama Club for the year.
