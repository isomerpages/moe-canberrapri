<p>Eating is a necessity while cooking is an art. In our CCA, pupils have
the opportunity to holistically learn the art of cooking. Not only will
they experience the hands-on session, but pupils will also learn the theory
aspect of cooking and safe food handling. They will also make use of the
technology to present their group discussions and tasks.</p>
<p>In Term 1, pupils experienced some bonding activities such as games and
interesting activities. During our Chinese New Year period, they learnt
the cultural aspects of the festivities. The highlights of the Term 1 include
making their own breakfast bar and dessert that can be served to guests.</p>
<p>Following the hands-on activities, pupils present on their group’s discussion
and products. Through this activity, confidence is instilled and pupils
learnt presentation skills. Pupils also learnt different ways of cooking
dishes from different cultures.</p>
