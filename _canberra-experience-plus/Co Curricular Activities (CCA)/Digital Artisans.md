<p>The Digital Artisans Club offers a comprehensive curriculum that nurtures
students' creativity and technical skills through progressive learning.
Primary 3 students begin with game development and digital storytelling
using Scratch block coding. In Primary 4, they advance to mobile app development,
where they learn Swift coding to create their own applications. Primary
5 and Primary 6 students explore elements of virtual reality exploration,
artificial intelligence and robotics, equipping them with essential skills
for the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Digital Artisans Club provides an excellent platform for students
to develop their interest and proficiency in coding, programming, and robotics
while fostering teamwork and leadership skills. It is both an engaging
and challenging experience that prepares students for future careers in
technology and innovation. Additionally, club members are encouraged to
participate in national competitions, allowing them to apply their coding
skills in fun and meaningful ways.</p>
