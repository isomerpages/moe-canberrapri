<p>CPS Badminton aims to equip our pupils with basic badminton skills and
to instil in them ICREST values and sportsmanship</p>
<p>Our members comprise pupils from Primary 3 to Primary 6. All our members
strive to attain the skills to play in this sport. The school team will
also be given opportunities to represent the school to take part in invitational
and zonal competitions, as well as National Championships.</p>
