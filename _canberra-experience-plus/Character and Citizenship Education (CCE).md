**Vision:** Caring Leaders, Responsible Citizens

**Mission:** To build and nurture every Canberrian to become a caring and responsible citizen who strives for excellence through self-discipline, teamwork and innovation.

Our school believes that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is an integral part of the studentsâ€™ holistic development. Building on our school values of **Innovation, Care, Responsibility, Excellence, Self-Discipline and Teamwork (iCREST)**, we aim to develop in our students good character, resilience and social-emotional well-being, future readiness and active citizenship.  

In school, CCE is enacted with intentionality, through CCE Lessons during curriculum time, planned student development learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school. Social-emotional competencies are taught, demonstrated and applied through explicit instruction, planned authentic learning experiences, as well as teachable moments. 

We strive to build a caring and enabling school environment that is characterised by caring and responsible leadership, a pervasive growth mindset, emotional and physical safety, and a focus on learning and development of students. CCE provides the knowledge and skills to help our students make sense of their life experiences and the language to express their learning and development.
