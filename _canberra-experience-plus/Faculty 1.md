**Vision:** Every Canberrian an All- Rounded Student

**Mission:** To bring out the best in every Canberrian through Canberra Experience Plus

As we welcome our students to Faculty 1, we aim to provide a smooth and successful transition from preschool to Primary 1 while making learning meaningful and enjoyable. With our Faculty’s focus of “Knowing your Part through Care and Responsibility”, we have purposefully designed various programmes to engage, nurture and empower learners by igniting the joy of learning and to develop them holistically.

To promote an inclusive learning environment, our teachers have put in place processes to understand the readiness and needs of our students. Our experienced teachers will subsequently carry out developmentally appropriate teaching strategies to support young learners who have diverse learning needs.

Beyond the classroom, students also take part in an array of learning experiences such as learning journeys and interest exposure programmes to cultivate natural curiosity, resilience, and unique talents in them.

These initiatives encourage a student-centric and all-rounded education that is infused with values by enriching the mind, engaging the heart and empowering the hands.
