**Vision:** Problem Solvers & Innovative Leaders<br>

**Mission:** Every Child an inquirer with critical thinking, collaborative & sound scientific thinking skills

The Science Department programme aims to ignite the joy of learning through our Canberra Experience Plus with 3 Ins: Inspire, Inquire & Innovate. Inquiry-based learning is our key programme designed to expose pupils to real-world happenings, deepen their understanding through using the 6-step Scientific Method in solving Science problems and develop their scientific reasoning skills. Anchoring on core values at the heart of learning and the 3Ts -Trusting to Learn, Trusting My Learning and Trusting My Talent, each programme seeks to stimulate pupils’ curiosity and encourage them to embark on a journey of inquiry to discover new knowledge and make meaning in relation to their daily lives.

**Department Key Programmes:**
