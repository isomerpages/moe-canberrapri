**The Value of Arts Education**  

The Arts is integral to the holistic development of our pupils. It contributes to their development of an understanding of the physical, emotional, intellectual, aesthetic, social, moral and spiritual dimensions of human experience.

The role of arts education is central in developing in our pupils a lively curiosity and an inquisitive mind. This is essential as it promotes inventive thinking and an innovative disposition in what they do.

Arts education is also the gateway to our pupilsâ€™ sense of aesthetics, which is the basis of how they perceive the world at large and all that is around them. Such a perspective helps them make meaning of their lives, culture and identity.
