In recent times, there has been a major shift away from academic results to a broader, more holistic education which focuses on opportunities for pupils to discover their interests and talents, and develop life skills, a sense of curiosity and a love for learning.

Canberra Primary School, in keeping with these changes and building upon its vibrant and pervasive culture of innovation, has placed a premium on innovating curriculum to enhance studentsâ€™ learning experiences. Leveraging its achievements in the FutureSchools@Singapore Programme and Applied Learning Programme, technology as a key enabler in enhancing the way students live, work and play, has helped to transform the classrooms, modify and even redefine learning tasks to create new learning experiences that were previously inconceivable.
