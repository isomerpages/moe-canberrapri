**Vision**: Every Canberrian an All-Rounded Student

**Mission**: To bring out the best in every Canberrian through Canberra Experience+


In Faculty 3, students experience the Graduation process with the focus on “Capturing the moment through Innovation and Excellence”. We aim to prepare the students for the transition to secondary school by orientating them towards future learning. We seek to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary attitudes, skills and knowledge to navigate an ever-changing, technology-rich environment.

In order for students to thrive in future, students need to possess the spirit of inquiry, the desire to create new knowledge and value, the ability to discover, discern and distil. Therefore, we have purposefully designed various programmes to engage, nurture and empower students by igniting the joy of learning and enabling them to learn for life.

**Department Key Programmes:**
* P5 Motivational Workshop 
* P5 Global Sustainable Development Programme
* P5 Outdoor Learning Experience
* P5 National Education (NE) Show
* P5 and P6 Museum-based Learning Journeys
* P6 Graduation Programme (after PSLE)
