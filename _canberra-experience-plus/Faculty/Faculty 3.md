**Vision**: Every Canberrian an All-Rounded Student

**Mission**: To bring out the best in every Canberrian through Canberra Experience Plus

In Faculty 3, students experience their pivotal graduation journey, embracing our philosophy of "Capturing the moment through Integrity and Excellence". As we prepare our students for their secondary school transition, we focus on developing well-rounded individuals ready to embrace future challenges.

Our comprehensive approach ensures students are equipped with essential competencies to thrive in an increasingly dynamic, technology-driven world. We cultivate critical thinking, adaptability, and resilience—qualities that are fundamental to their continued success.

Through the Faculty 3 programmes, we encourage students to develop their curiosity and problem-solving skills. We create opportunities for them to explore, question, and learn independently, helping them build confidence in their abilities. Our aim is to nurture students who are ready to take on new challenges and continue learning beyond their primary school years.

**Faculty Key Programmes:**

*   P5 Outdoor Learning Experience
*   P5 National Education (NE) Show
*   P5 and P6 Museum-based Learning Journeys
*   P6 Graduation Programme (after PSLE)
