**Vision:** Every Canberrian an All-Rounded Student

**Mission:** To bring out the best in every Canberrian through Canberra Experience Plus

Another exciting journey begins for our students in Faculty 2 as they embark on an array of learning experiences to seek meanings, values and connections as attuned learners. With our Faculty’s focus of “Levelling Up through Self-Discipline and Teamwork”, we aim to promote the joy of learning by providing opportunities for our students to develop their passion and interests holistically, nurturing their talents and empowering them in an inclusive learning environment.

To embrace learning for life, we have purposefully designed various student-centric programmes and learning experiences that emphasise on the application of collaboration and life skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines (Curriculum Integration) and in relation to real-world context. These initiatives engage our diverse learners with a connected learning experience to explore and learn in an authentic learning setting in and out of the classroom boundaries.

With the unique and meaningful learning adventures in Faculty 2, we provide a balance between a splendour of learning and academic rigour to support the holistic development of our students to develop their knowledge, skills and aptitude to succeed in life.

* Interest-Based Programme (IBP)
