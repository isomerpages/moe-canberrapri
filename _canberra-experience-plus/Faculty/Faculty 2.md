**Vision:** Every Canberrian an All-Rounded Student

**Mission:** To bring out the best in every Canberrian through Canberra Experience Plus

Another exciting journey begins for our students in Faculty 2 as they engage in meaningful learning experiences that foster curiosity, values, and connections. With our Faculty’s focus on _“Levelling Up through Self-Discipline and Teamwork,”_ we have purposefully designed student-centric programmes and learning experiences that ignite the joy of learning, empowering students to develop as lifelong learners. <br>

Through _Curriculum Integration_, students apply collaboration and life skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines and real-world contexts. This fosters critical thinking and adaptability, helping them embrace diverse perspectives. Additionally, these initiatives offer a connected learning experience that engages students in authentic settings both within and beyond the classroom.

With our unique and purposeful learning adventures in Faculty 2, we strike a balance between academic rigour and the joy of learning, supporting the holistic development of our students. By instilling the values of _Every Child a STAR_, we empower Canberrians with the knowledge, skills, and mindset to thrive, lead, and succeed in life.<br>
