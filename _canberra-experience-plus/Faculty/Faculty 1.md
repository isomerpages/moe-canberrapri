**Vision:** Every Canberrian an All-Rounded Student

**Mission:** To bring out the best in every Canberrian through Canberra Experience Plus

As we welcome our students to Faculty 1, we aim to provide a smooth and successful transition from preschool to Primary 1 while making learning meaningful and enjoyable. With our faculty’s focus of “Knowing your Part through Care and Respect”, our programmes nurture students as Discoverers who appreciate diverse perspectives, Learners who value knowledge and new experiences, and Leaders who show respect through actions and words. Through these roles, we ignite the joy of learning and develop them holistically.

To promote an inclusive learning environment, our experienced teachers have established processes to understand students' readiness and needs. They implement developmentally appropriate teaching strategies to support learners with diverse learning needs. Beyond the classroom, students participate in learning journeys and interest exposure programmes that cultivate their natural curiosity, resilience, and unique talents.

These initiatives create a student-centric and well-rounded education that enriches the mind, engages the heart and empowers the hands through values-based learning.
