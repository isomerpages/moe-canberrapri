Since its formation in 2010, the CPS Concert Band had been involved in various school performances such as the school Musicals, Open House, National Day Observance Ceremony and Mid-Autumn Festival. In addition to performing in concert settings, the band is also capable of moving in formations while playing their musical instruments. 

The Band Studio, which was officially opened on 22 May 2015, provides a conducive environment for the young musicians to develop their love for music and discover their talents within. Our instructor has passionately inculcated in students the love for music and the values to build confidence and develop leadership skills. 

Together with our nurturing teachers, we welcome all students to join us. No prior music background is required. All that is needed is the love for music and the perseverance to learn a new instrument.
