Step into the literary world with the Library Ambassadors Club CCA as members spark the love and joy in reading amongst their peers through book reviews, sharings and recommendations.

They also leverage on technology-enabled applied learning experience by using their 1:1 Personal Learning Device (iPads) to create digital flipbooks to engage their readers. 

The CCA members also help out in the daily operations and maintenance of the library and serve as student Library Ambassadors during school events.

To make learning more diversified, Blended Learning through asynchronous platforms such as SLS and Zoom sessions are incorporated during the CCA sessions.
