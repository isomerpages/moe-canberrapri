Canberra Primary School’s Floorball CCA first started in the year 2016 with the aim to develop necessary technical skills such as dribbling, passing and shooting in our students. Additionally, we also aim to develop tactical understanding of the sport such as spatial awareness, offence and defence in Floorball. Apart from skills specific to Floorball, the students will also learn values such as self-discipline, teamwork and sportsmanship.

The boys’ and girls’ school teams have participated in various National School Games and tournaments organised by MOE.
