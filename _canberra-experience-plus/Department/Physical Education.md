**Vision:** Every Canberrian An Attuned Learner Through Physical Education

**Mission:** To deliver quality Physical Education that promotes participation, progress and performance through effective and current teaching strategies

The Physical Education and Co-Curricular Activities Department seeks to educate our students on the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle through physical activities and health education. A holistic approach is adopted to teach them to be healthy physically and mentally, and it is hoped that the knowledge they receive will be carried into their adult life. Through CCA, students also learn the competencies and values needed so that they become well-balanced individuals ready to face the world. The variety of CCAs we offer caters to the differing needs and interests of our students, enriching their primary school experience.
