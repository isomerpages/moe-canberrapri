<p><strong>Vision:</strong> Every Canberrian An Attuned Learner Through Physical
Education</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> To deliver quality Physical Education that promotes
participation, progress and performance through effective and current teaching
strategies</p>
<p>The Physical Education and Co-Curricular Activities Department aims to
instill the importance of a healthy lifestyle through physical activities
and health education. By adopting a holistic approach, we nurture students'
physical and mental well-being, equipping them with lifelong healthy habits.
Our programme encourages students to develop essential values and competencies,
shaping them into well-rounded individuals prepared for future challenges.
Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) further enhance their growth by providing
diverse opportunities that cater to their unique interests and talents.
With a wide range of CCAs available, students can explore their passions,
build teamwork skills, and develop resilience. These experiences enrich
their primary school journey, fostering personal growth and confidence.
We believe that the lessons learned through physical education and co-curricular
participation will extend beyond school, empowering students to lead balanced
and fulfilling lives. Ultimately, our goal is to prepare them for a bright
and healthy future.</p>
