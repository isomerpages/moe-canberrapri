Canberra Primary School adopts a formative approach to assessment by using bite-sized assessments to scaffold learning, provide specific feedback to improve learning and make assessment less stressful for pupils. 

**Programmes and Events** 

Across the three faculties, differentiated programmes are designed to cater to learners of varying abilities. These initiatives offer additional support in developing essential numerical skills while fostering creative thinking. School-wide efforts are also implemented to ensure that Mathematics learning remains relevant and applicable to real-life contexts.

**Financial Literacy**<br>
Financial Literacy is a critical life skill that equips students with the knowledge and understanding of saving, budgeting, money management, and investing. Teaching them about finances at an early age can have long-lasting positive effects on their financial habits, behavior, and future success. Some of the key benefits of financial literacy for students include better understanding of Needs vs. Wants, develop good money habits early, fostering a sense of responsibility, increased confidence in making financial decisions, improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills, preparation for future financial independence and breaking the cycle of financial struggles.

The school's Financial Literacy program is designed to raise awareness of four fundamental financial concepts: Save, Spend, Manage, and Share. These concepts are deeply integrated into the curriculum to help students develop the skill of managing money wisely. By using the Young Savvy Saver and Spender card, students engage in various Parent-Child activities, classroom exercises, and SLS gamification packages to earn stars over the course of their six years in school, which they can exchange for tokens each year. 

Financial literacy is an invaluable tool for preparing students for a secure financial future. By introducing them to the concepts of money early, we set them on a path toward lifelong financial well-being.
