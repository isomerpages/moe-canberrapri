**Vision:** Problem Solvers &amp; Innovative Leaders<br>

**Mission:** Every Child an inquirer with critical thinking, collaborative &amp; sound scientific thinking skills

The Science Department aims to ignite the joy of learning through our Canberra Experience Plus with the 3 Ins: Inspire, Inquire &amp; Innovate. Our Inquiry-Based Learning approach engages students in real-world exploration, deepening their understanding through the 6-step Scientific Method and fostering scientific reasoning.
Our programme emphasizes Demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science, Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge, and Relating Science, Technology, Society, and Environment. Through Curriculum Integration – Sustainable Food for the Future, students connect learning to real-world challenges.
Guided by our core values and the 3Ts – Trusting to Learn, Trusting My Learning, and Trusting My Talent, we nurture curiosity, critical thinking, and innovation. Each experience encourages students to embark on a journey of inquiry, discover new knowledge, and make meaningful connections to their daily lives.
