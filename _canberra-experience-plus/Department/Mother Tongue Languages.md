<p><strong>Vision:</strong> Our pupils will be passionate and lifelong learners
of the Mother Tongue Language</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> To create an environment where pupils will learn
and apply the Mother Tongue Language effectively and confidently</p>
<p>Bingualism being the cornerstone of our education system, the Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL) department aligns our curricular goals with the national
curriculum and strives to engage our pupils in joyful learning and enable
them to communicate effectively and confidently in MTL and have a deeper
appreciation of their cultural heritage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To better engage our pupils, we create opportunities for them to learn
and apply the various language skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing,
as well as spoken and written interaction) in authentic situations within
and beyond the classroom. MTL lessons are also infused with Curriculum
Integration (CI) and e-Pedagogy to make the learning of MTL more interesting.</p>
