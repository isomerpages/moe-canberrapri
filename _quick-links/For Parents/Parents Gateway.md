Parents Gateway is a mobile application (or "app") that supports parents and schools on key administrative matters, providing MOE and schools with the platform to send updates on programmes and activities to parents. At the same time, Parents Gateway allows parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities and declaring travel plans.

It aims to aggregate parent-teacher communications securely on a centralised digital platform. For more information and FAQs on PG, please click [here](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/).
