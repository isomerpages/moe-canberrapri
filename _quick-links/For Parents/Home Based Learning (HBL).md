**HBL/FHBL & Staggered Timing Access**<br>
During the HBL/FHBL period, parents/guardians are encouraged to keep your child/ward at home where possible. HBL/FHBL comprises of activities that come in different forms, such as e-lessons through the use of Student Learning Spaces (SLS), or other references like worksheets and textbooks. These learning activities have been designed to allow your child/ward to complete them independently. They are encouraged to use the staggered timings to login to SLS to access their detailed lesson guides and mark their daily attendance as shown in Table 1: <br>

At times, your child/ward's teachers may be conducting synchronous lessons or interaction sessions. The teachers will specify the details via SLS. Please note that the synchronous sessions may be recorded to support others who are unable to join in at the specified time.
