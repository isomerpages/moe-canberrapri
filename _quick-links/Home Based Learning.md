# Home-Based Learning
In Canberra Primary School, to ensure continuity of learning, HBL can take in the form of

*  **e-Learning**: comprises of a range of online activities on different e-learning platforms

*  **Home-Based Learning (HBL)**: comprises of both offline and/or online* learning in the event of school closure for some of the levels 

* **Full HBL (FHBL)**: comprises of both offline and/or online* learning in the event of school closure for all Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels

*online learning can be in the form of synchronous (live) or asynchronous

**HBL/FHBL & Staggered Timing Access**

During the HBL/FHBL period, parents/guardians are encouraged to keep your child/ward at home where possible. HBL/FHBL comprises of activities that come in different forms, such as e-lessons through the use of Student Learning Spaces (SLS), or other references like worksheets and textbooks. These learning activities have been designed to allow your child/ward to complete them independently. They are encouraged to use the staggered timings to login to SLS to access their detailed lesson guides and mark their daily attendance as shown in Table 1:
