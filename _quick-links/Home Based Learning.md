**HBL/FHBL & Staggered Timing Access**

During the HBL/FHBL period, parents/guardians are encouraged to keep your child/ward at home where possible. HBL/FHBL comprises of activities that come in different forms, such as e-lessons through the use of Student Learning Spaces (SLS), or other references like worksheets and textbooks. These learning activities have been designed to allow your child/ward to complete them independently. They are encouraged to use the staggered timings to login to SLS to access their detailed lesson guides and mark their daily attendance as shown in Table 1:
