# Applied Learning Programme

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) was introduced by MOE to help students connect academic knowledge and skills with the real world.  Students would be able to appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic arena and to develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills.
