# Programmes P1 to P6
**Programmes (From Primary 1 to 6)**

Inquiry-based learning is our key programme designed to expose pupils to real-world happenings, deepen their understanding through using the 6-step Scientific Method in solving Science problems and develop their scientific reasoning skills.

Complementing the inquiry-based learning is our in-house learning approach known as RICHES created to guide pupils in making sense of Science questions and how to answer them in a systematic manner through annotating essential clues. The CER strategy complements RICHES so that pupils are able to explain scientific concepts with sound scientific reasoning skills.
