# Programmes P1 to P6
**Programmes (From Primary 1 to 6)**

Inquiry-based learning is our key programme designed to expose pupils to real-world happenings, deepen their understanding through using the 6-step Scientific Method in solving Science problems and develop their scientific reasoning skills.

Complementing the inquiry-based learning is our in-house learning approach known as RICHES created to guide pupils in making sense of Science questions and how to answer them in a systematic manner through annotating essential clues. The CER strategy complements RICHES so that pupils are able to explain scientific concepts with sound scientific reasoning skills.

Anchoring on core values at the heart of learning and the 3Ts -Trusting to Learn, Trusting My Learning and Trusting My Talent, each programme seeks to stimulate pupils’ curiosity and encourage them to embark on a journey of inquiry to discover new knowledge and make meaning in relation to their daily lives. The progression of acquiring Scientific knowledge and skills follows a step-by-step approach as outlined in the Table.

# Community in Nature (CIN)
Community in Nature (CIN) is a national movement to conserve Singapore’s natural heritage. It brings together all of NParks’ nature-related events, activities and programmes with the aim of connecting, engaging and inspiring diverse communities to help conserve our natural heritage. Our CIN ambassadors have carried out research on scientific topics and present their ideas in the form of posters.

Posters designed by P5 CIN Ambassadors as a platform to reach out to their fellow school mates to share with them information about the Wildlife in Singapore.
