**We are pleased to be recognised as an Apple Distinguished School for 2015 - 2021 for our implementation of the ‘Start Young, Start It Right Programme - Curating My Learning’ and ‘Ready for Tomorrow - Orientation to My Future Learning’.**

**Our Story**

Canberra Primary School, located in the township of Sembawang in northern Singapore, has established itself as a choice school since its inception in 2000. Affirming the school’s innovative practices and programmes, Singapore’s Ministry of Education (MOE) invited it to participate in the FutureSchools@Singapore initiative in 2012. In line with this, the school identified the use of mobile personal learning devices (PLDs) as a technology enabler to deliver the school’s learning outcomes. Having entered the ninth year of its 1:1 learning programme using iPad, Canberra Primary School continuously strives to enhance its innovative teaching and learning environment.

**Vision**

Canberra Primary School believes that every Canberrian can succeed, regardless of the child’s starting point. This belief has been instrumental in shaping the culture of the school as well as the teaching and learning experiences, collectively known as the Canberra Experience.

**Learning**

To actualise the Canberra Experience and deepen students’ learning processes, the school has advanced the Canberra Experience Plus to take learning to a different dimension, helping every student to achieve his/her potential, giving him/her wings to soar to greater heights, and confidently face new challenges. The Canberra Experience Plus journey focuses on the holistic development of every Canberrian, providing opportunities for all of them to further their interests and develop their unique talents.
