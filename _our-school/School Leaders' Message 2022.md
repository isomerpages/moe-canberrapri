# School Leaders' Message 2022

Warmest greetings from Canberra Primary School!

2021 has been a challenging year for all schools in Singapore as we grappled with the Covid-19 pandemic. Our pupils, staff and the community have shown tremendous fortitude and resilience and we applaud them for their unwavering dedication and support.

Despite the challenges, 2021 continued to be a year of excitement for Canberrians. Anchoring on the theme - ‘Be Well, Do Well’, our pupils and staff took ownership of our holistic health: physical, intellectual, emotional and social. We then extend our care to others and pursue excellence in all our actions. We celebrated the wonderful performance of our 2021 Primary Six graduands, who have done us proud by performing very well under the new Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system. 100% of our students have graduated and moved on to secondary schools of their choice. We wish them all the very best in their endeavours and look forward to them demonstrating the Canberra spirit as they soar!

Moving on into 2022, we welcome Mdm Ong Lixiang Joyce, who has joined the Canberra Primary family with effect from 15 December 2021 as Vice-Principal. At the same time, we thank our former Vice-Principal, Ms Stephanie Louise Ho, for her dedication and leadership, and we wish her all the very best.

 The change in Vice-Principals is part of an ongoing process of leadership renewal to support Canberra Primary as it grows strength to strength. Mr Wong has retired officially in January 2021 and we are delighted to share that he has rejoined the Education Service to lead Canberra Primary to be a leading learning organization that inspires and is valued globally. We will continue to enhance our Canberra Experience Plus learning for every Canberrian, premising on our 2022 theme:

 *Be Well, Do Well and Beyond...*

 Riding on 2022’s theme and focus, we commit ourselves to making our school a safe and conducive learning place and for us to extend our care and contribution to the school, nation and global community. We also hope for our staff and pupils to find inner sense of happiness and to discover new opportunities.

For our ALP, ‘Start Young, Start It Right – Curating My Learning’, pupils can continue to look forward to a more connected learning experience, enhanced by the use of Personal Learning Devices in authentic settings. Varied learning experiences, such as coding, are also designed to help pupils acquire critical thinking skills.

With respect to our LLP, ‘Immersing in Canberra Experience through Musical Theatre Education’, we have strengthened the collaboration with local and overseas schools to develop a future oriented learning experience, focusing on National pride and Sustainability. In February 2022, pupils, staff and the community can look forward to the ‘Celebration of Learning’. In partnership with Gardens By the Bay Singapore, a virtual gallery will be set up to capture pupils’ learning and share creative ideas to promote sustainability to the local and global community.

In addition to our distinctive programmes, the interest-based tracks at the Primary 3 level and Primary 4 level will be continued in 2022. Based on pupils’ interests in aesthetics, sports, languages or reasoning, our Primary 3 and 4 pupils will have opportunities to explore differentiated learning experiences. Our students will not only develop confidence and skills they need to succeed in life, they will also acquire the competencies needed to be future-ready learners.

 As we move ahead this year, let us continue to work closely with our stakeholders and partners to provide rich and meaningful experiences that promote splendour and fulfilment in learning.

 We wish everyone a fruitful 2022!
