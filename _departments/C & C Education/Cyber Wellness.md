With the Vision “Future Ready and Digitally Responsible Citizen” in mind, Cyber Wellness plays a vital role in developing pupils to be such citizens. The creation of “Digital Defence” as the sixth pillar of Total Defence shows that it is essential to develop pupils’ knowledge and skills in cyber wellness issues.

Below is the MOE Cyber Wellness Framework.

Taking the MOE Cyber Wellness Framework as reference, CPS has created and develop our own framework below.

The P1 and P2 pupils will focus on the Concept of **Self**. Here, pupils will be taught how to be _safe and responsible users_ through topic such as netiquette.

The P3 and P4 pupils will focus on the Concept of **Peers**, where they will learn topics such as Social Media and cyber safety to have _positive peer influence_ in the cyber world.

The P5 and P6 pupils will focus on **Community**. Here, they will learn the value of _Respecting Self and Others_ through topics such as Copyright Issues and Game Addiction.

  

 Cyber Wellness is promoted in school through:  

·       Recess Activities

·       Cyber Wellness Day

·       FTGP lessons

·       Bite-sized Cyber Wellness Sharing during Pre-assembly

**Working with Parents**

Parents play an equally important role in developing their child to be a future ready and digitally responsible citizen. We are currently liaising with the Family Matters Services (FMS) on conducting workshops that focus on cyber issues. We have also included some tip sheets below for parents to refer to in handling some pertinent cyber issue.
