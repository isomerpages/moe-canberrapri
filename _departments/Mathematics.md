# PEDAGOGY AND APPROACH

![](/images/23mar16_Maths_Pedagogy%20and%20Approach.png)

# Programmes and Events

Across the three faculties, there are differentiated programmes for the different ability learners. These programmes serve to provide additional support for acquiring fundamental numerical skills and exposing pupils to think creatively and “out of the box”. School-wide initiatives aim to make Mathematics learning authentic and meaningful in everyday life.
