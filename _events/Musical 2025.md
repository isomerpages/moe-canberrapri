Cultural Centre Theatre, Republic Polytechnic, on Friday, 11 July 2025.</p>

found in unity, and the beauty of bridging past traditions with future
dreams. Watch as their story unfolds through spellbinding dance numbers,
heartfelt performances, and soul-stirring music, building to our powerful
finale - "Together We Shine" - a triumphant celebration of collective spirit
and shared aspirations.</p>
<p>This production is more than just a performance; it's a heartfelt tribute
to every student, teacher, school leader and staff member who has been
part of our remarkable journey. Each scene reflects the spirit that has
made our school special for the past twenty-five years.</p>

with their boundless energy, remarkable talent, and genuine passion. Together,

to come.</p>
