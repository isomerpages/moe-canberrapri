**Learn for Life Programme (LLP):** Immersing in Canberra Experience through Musical Theatre Education

Our LLP aims to develop every Canberrians to be a discoverer, attuned learner and global learner through musical theatre education. Our musical theatre education embodies the art, music, dance and drama in both the curriculum and co-curriculum. Our LLP nurtures our pupils’ passion in the arts, providing them with the platforms for performance and appreciation. Through this, our LLP allows our pupils to explore issues and emotions, develop empathy for the experiences of others and self, and explore diverse perspectives as we prepare them to become more confident, creative and collaborative individuals. Our LLP works in tandem with our Arts curriculum and development.

Our LLP encompasses 3 overarching programmes that align to our 3Es Approach: Expose, Experience and Enrich. These programmes are:

**•	Theatrical Experience**

Our theatrical experience aims to take our pupils to a different dimension in learning. Our pupils get to experience a theatrical show as audience either in theatres or school. They would also get the opportunity to get hands-on experience as participants. This experience will promote the joy of learning.

**•	Graduation By Performance**

This platform allows our pupils’ learning to culminate into a production and performance. This becomes part of celebration of learning for all our Primary 2 and Primary 6 pupils. It strengthens the class camaraderie and develops greater self-awareness and relationship management in our pupils.

**•	Canberra Young Artist’s Academy**

The academy aims to further develop and deepen pupils’ diverse innate talents and abilities in the Arts. The school introduces these platforms to engage our Arts enthusiasts: Sing Canberra, Canberra’s Got Talent, The Little Composer and The Visual Arts Ambassadors. These platforms strengthen our pupils’ confidence and promote self-directed learning.
