The Applied Learning Programme was introduced by MOE to expose students to learning by doing, and learning in real-world scenarios. In Canberra Primary School, our ALP (Digital Making) aims to develop Canberrians to be future-ready and responsible digital learners by evoking curiosity in learning, developing inventive thinking and encouraging a dare-to-try spirit. Students would be able to appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic area and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. Pupils will also be able to engage in hands-on, experiential learning to situate, acquire and apply their learning in real-world contexts. It comprises of two stages:

* Foundation Stage: Start Young Start It Right - Curating My Learning 
* Orientation Stage: Orientation to My Future Learning - Ready for Tomorrow

Given the changes in the education landscape and shift towards leveraging digital platforms, in 2021, the school has reframed and realigned its ALP objectives as follows:

Foundation Stage: Start Young Start It Right – Curating My Learning


*   Equip pupils with Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) as a technology enabler to deliver the school and applied learning outcomes
*   Provide pupils with a connected learning experience, enhanced by the integration of ICT using their PLDs in authentic learning settings and by harnessing coding that enables computational thinking for problem solving 
*   Inculcate habits and values of learning with PLDs into our pupils, thereby developing their 21st Century Competencies and Digital Literacy Skills

* Continue pupils’ technology-enabled applied learning journey with production-centered learning and by leveraging digital media and communication elements to engage and influence
* Broaden opportunities for pupils to discover their interests and talents, develop life skills, a sense of curiosity and a love for learning
* Bridge pupils’ continual learning into secondary school
