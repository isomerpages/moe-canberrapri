<p>The Applied Learning Programme, introduced by MOE, exposes students to
learning through hands-on experiences and real-world scenarios. At Canberra
Primary School, our ALP (Digital Making) aims to develop Canberrians to
be future-ready and responsible digital learners by evoking curiosity,
developing inventive thinking and fostering a dare-to-try spirit. Through
this programme, students appreciate the relevance and value of their academic
learning, developing stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge
and skills. They engage in hands-on, experiential learning that allows
them to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts. It comprises of two
stages:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foundation Stage: Start Young Start It Right - Curating My Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orientation Stage: Orientation to My Future Learning - Ready for Tomorrow</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the changes in the education landscape and shift towards leveraging
digital platforms, in 2021, the school has reframed and realigned its ALP
objectives as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Foundation Stage: Start Young Start It Right – Curating My Learning</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Equip students with Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) as a technology enabler
to deliver the school and applied learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide students with a connected learning experience, enhanced by the
integration of ICT using their PLDs in authentic learning settings and
by harnessing coding that enables computational thinking for problem solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inculcate habits and values of learning with PLDs into our students, thereby
developing their 21st Century Competencies and Digital Literacy Skills</p>
