<p>The Applied Learning Programme, introduced by MOE, exposes students to
learning through hands-on experiences and real-world scenarios. At Canberra
Primary School, our ALP (Digital Making) aims to develop Canberrians to
be future-ready and responsible digital learners by evoking curiosity,
developing inventive thinking and fostering a dare-to-try spirit. Through
this programme, students appreciate the relevance and value of their academic
learning, developing stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge
and skills. They engage in hands-on, experiential learning that allows
them to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts. It comprises of two
stages:</p>

<p>Orientation Stage: Orientation to My Future Learning - Ready for Tomorrow</p>

<p>Given the changes in the education landscape and shift towards leveraging
digital platforms, in 2021, the school has reframed and realigned its ALP
objectives as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foundation Stage: Start Young Start It Right – Curating My Learning</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equip students with
Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) as a technology enabler to deliver the
school and applied learning outcomes</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide students with
a connected learning experience, enhanced by the integration of ICT using
their PLDs in authentic learning settings and by harnessing coding that
enables computational thinking for problem solving</p>
<p>Inculcate habits and values of learning with PLDs into our students, thereby
developing their 21st Century Competencies and Digital Literacy Skills</p>

<p>Orientation Stage: Orientation to Future Learning – Ready for Tomorrow</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue students’ technology-enabled
applied learning journey with production-centered learning and by leveraging
digital media and communication elements to engage and influence</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broaden opportunities
for students to discover their interests and talents, develop life skills,
a sense of curiosity and a love for learning</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridge students’ continual
learning into secondary school</p>
